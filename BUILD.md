## dependencies

There are not really dependencies, but you'll need some tools to create the epub : 

  1. The official markdown to HTML converter `Markdown.pl` that can be found at [markdown website](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown)
  2. A perl interpreter to execute this converter
  3. The program `make`
  4. The program `zip`
